# Scheduler-Project-UI
UI for a scheduler project, uses an algorithm and database not included
Will give errors based on database not being present, I am not allowed to release database due to NDA.

Shows example of my UI work in Winbdows forms.
Tables are accomplished through added SourceGrid library.

SourceGrid in an open source extension to Windows forms components and adds better looking tables.
Adding this extension saved hours of development time for UI.
